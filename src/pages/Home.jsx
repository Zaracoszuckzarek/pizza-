      <p>The History of cd Za
      Ancient Origins
      Pizza dates back thousands of years, believe it or not, tracing its roots back to the flatbreads with toppings that were popular with ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. But modern pizza, the flatbreads with tomato sauce, cheese, and toppings, was born along the western coast of Italy, in the city of Naples.Naples too has a long history, dating back to 600 B.C. when the Greeks first settled it. Over time, Naples became a thriving city on the water. In the 18th and 19th century it was booming, with a population packed into a dense area, Naples was notorious for its masses of poor, working class people. Those people needed to eat! That meant inexpensive food, and since much of their lives were spent outdoors, it needed to be able to be eaten quickly and easily affordable for all. And thus, pizza was born! That is right, even from the beginning people have been eating pizza for breakfast! ( do not let anyone tellFlatbreads sold by street vendors were then topped with tomatoes, cheese, garlic, anchovies, oil became the food of the time, available for every meal  you otherwise!)When the King and Queen of Italy visited Naples in 1889, they tried an assortment of pizza from the city local Pizzeria Brandi. Legend has it that the king and queen were bored with their high class French diets and wanted something new. They found their new favorite in a pizza called the pizza mozzarella. It was topped with white cheese, red tomatoes, and green basil - the pie took  is new name from the queen – Margherita pizza. Despite this royal validation, pizza would remain relatively unknown in Italy outside of Naples until the 1940s.
      But elsewhere… across the ocean, pizza was booming</p>
      <p>Pizza in the New World
      Immigrants from Naples were landing in America and coming for their new opportunities! The millions of Europeans immigrating at that time were taking on factory jobs and other labor, but with them came their favored dish, pizza! As the Neapolitans were cooking up pizzas for themselves, the taste of pizza spread and soon, in New York, Boston, Trenton, and more pizza shops began sprouting up, to the delight of everyone around!
      One of the earliest pizzerias in the U.S. was opened in Manhattan,  Lombardi, named for its owner Gennaro Lombardi. As of today, 116 years(!) later, Lombardi is still selling up slices from that same oven! While they moved locations, they took the oven with them.
      From then it was only a matter of time as pizza raced across the nation, spreading with Italian-Americas across the United States. After World War II pizza took off in the U.S., no longer thought of as an ethnic food, it became a part of American food culture. New regional variants developed in the Midwest, in the South, and of course the New York-style pizza was defined.

      <p>started eating pizza because it was American. The rest of Italy finally got the big idea too!
      So, who invented pizza? The ancient people living around the Mediterranean made the first step by eating all their flatbreads with toppings. Then the people of When pizza finally took over America, it became just another American culture export to the rest of the world, like Coca-Cola and Elvis other countries Naples took it and created pizza as we understand it today.
